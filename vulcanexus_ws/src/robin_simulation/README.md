# Welding Process Simulator (Example Domain Adapter)

> **Note:** This is an **example domain adapter**, not a reusable ROBIN module.
> It simulates a welding process for testing the ROBIN modules without real hardware.
> Use this as a reference when writing your own process simulator.

This package provides a ROS 2 node that publishes simulated welding telemetry,
allowing the full ROBIN pipeline to be demonstrated without a physical robot.
